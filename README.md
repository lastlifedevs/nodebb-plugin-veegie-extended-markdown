# Extended Markdown for NodeBB

Adds support for a few non-standard Markdown options. A fork of [nodebb-plugin-spoilers](https://github.com/NodeBB-Community/nodebb-plugin-spoilers/), including its spoiler tag functionality.

Currently supports:

* Spoilers
* The insertion of a basic table along with a link to allow users to learn the Markdown table syntax.
